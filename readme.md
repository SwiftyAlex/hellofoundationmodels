![img](./assets/header.png)

This lil' sample app is provided as part of a workshop given at Swift Connection 2025.

If you missed the workshop, you can open up the `complete` folder to just play around with some lightweight examples if you'd like.

If you want to talk about foundation models, wether its getting started, or wanting help integrating them into your app, you can grab me on [X](https://x.com/SwiftyAlex).
